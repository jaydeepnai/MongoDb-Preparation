# MongoDB Logical Operators

Logical operators in MongoDB allow you to combine multiple query conditions to refine document selection. These operators enable complex queries by evaluating multiple expressions.

## 1. `$and`
**Description**: Matches documents that satisfy all conditions specified in an array.

## 2. `$or`
**Description**: Matches documents that satisfy at least one of the conditions in an array.

## 3. `$not`
**Description**: Inverts the result of a condition.

## 4. `$nor`
**Description**: Matches documents where none of the conditions are true.

These logical operators provide powerful ways to construct complex queries, allowing you to filter documents based on multiple conditions efficiently.
