# MongoDB Projection Operators

Projection operators in MongoDB are used to specify which fields to include or exclude in the results of a query. These operators allow for controlling the structure of the returned documents.

## 1. `$slice`
**Description**: Limits the number of elements returned from an array field.

## 2. `$meta`
**Description**: Accesses metadata from a field, such as text search score, when using `$text` indexes.

## 3. `$elemMatch`
**Description**: Projects a specific element of an array that matches the specified condition.

These projection operators allow you to refine the structure of documents returned from a query, providing flexibility in how data is presented or processed in MongoDB.
