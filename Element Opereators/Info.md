# MongoDB Element Operators

Element operators in MongoDB are used to query documents based on the presence of fields or the type of values stored in them. These operators help filter documents where certain fields exist or match specific data types.

## 1. `$exists`
**Description**: Matches documents where the specified field exists or does not exist.

## 2. `$type`
**Description**: Matches documents where the field is of the specified BSON data type.

These element operators allow precise filtering of documents based on field existence and data type, making them useful for schema validation and dynamic queries in MongoDB.
